Welcome to my new blog! This is my first post using Jekyll and GitHub Pages.

## What to expect

I'll be sharing posts about various topics here. Stay tuned for more content!

## Getting started with Jekyll

Jekyll makes it easy to write blog posts in Markdown. Just create a new file in the `_posts` directory with the format `YYYY-MM-DD-title.md` and add your content.

Thanks for reading!
